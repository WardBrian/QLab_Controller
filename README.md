# QLab Controller

This repository contains the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)-style C++ file used in Robsham Theatre Arts Center's QLab control box. 

This code relies on two libraries:
 - [MidiUSB](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/MIDIUSB) for sending MIDI over USB
 - [Bounce2](https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2) for easy control of the buttons

It also contains a PDF showing the [initial draft of the box](./Design.pdf) and a [list of parts](./PARTS.md).
